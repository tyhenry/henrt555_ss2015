shaders folder contains shapes and basic patterns

oF folder contains oF app that implements the patterns as video masks in a VJ style app.  The app takes videos from Vine (or preloaded videos of 400x400 resolution) and allows controls over pattern masks, as well as video effects (effect shaders), adding/deleting videos, selecting videos and re-sizing/re-positioning videos using a set of custom Arduino IR sensors, custom capactive touch pads, and Kinect blob tracking.
Video documentation is uploading!
